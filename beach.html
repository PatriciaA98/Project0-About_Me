        <h1>Beaches in Barbados</h1>
        <p>Barbados also known as the gem of the Caribbean has some of the most Beautiful Beaches. 
        There are a number of activities that one can enjoy while relaxing at any beach in Barbados.
        My favourite beach in Barbados is Carlisle Bay but is affectionately known by Bajans as Brownes Beach. 
        I enjoy Beaches at Brownes beach with my friends and family especially during the summer days.</p>
