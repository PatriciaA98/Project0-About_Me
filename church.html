        <h1>Why church is important to me</h1>
        <p>My Faith is important to me because I believe in ordeer to live this life you must have 
            a believe system that helps you to make sense of this world and you purpose. As a christian my nelieve and faith is in Jesus Christ.
        I believe that He came to earth and died on the cross to save me from my sins and then rose and now lives forever. 
        My belief in God gives me hope especially in times like this(COVID 19 Pandemic) 
        by giving me comfort in the fact that although all of the world's leaders is struggling to get things under control(the ecomony, medicine, people), 
        God is still in control and He is still more than able to save the world and He will Save the World. 
        Church is where we as the body of Christ meet together to encourage each other and support each other slong with prayering for countries</p>
